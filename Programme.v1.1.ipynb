University guidelines also prohibit nonauthorized voice and video recordings. 2 Extensive G ames with Perfect Information     ➢ Strategic game    ➢ Time is absent from the model.   ➢ It doesn’t  allow for the s equential structure of decision making.   ➢ Assumes  that each decision maker chooses her plan of action once and for all.   ➢ A player is not allowed to change her plan as events unfold.   ➢ Extensive game   ➢ The model describes the sequential structure of decision making explicitly   ➢ Allows us to study situations in w hich each decision maker is free to change her  mind as events unfold.  3 Example  of an Extensive G ame    Example  154.1 : Entry Game         Challenger                  In             Out            Incumbent           (1,2)        Acquiesce              Fight          (2 , 1)  (0 , 0)      Note:  Acquiesce means accommodate ( not fight)              4    Example  1: Miniultimatum game        Proposer       Stingy      Generous      Responder      Responder     Accept   Reject    Accept   Reject     (9 , 1)   (0 , 0)    (5 , 5)   (0 , 0)                5 Specification of the mini utlimatum game    Preferences:     U1(Stingy,Accept)=9;    U2(Stin gy,Accept)=1    U1(Stingy,Reject)=0;    U2(Stin gy,Reject)=0    U1(Generous,Accept)=5;   U2(Gene rous,Accept)=5    U1(Generous,Reject)=0;   U2(Gene rous,Reject)=0                              6 Strategies     A strategy  of a player in an extensive game is a com plete action plan, that is, it specifies an action  for every  situation where it is her turn to make a move!   In the mini ultimatum game , responder has 4 strategies   1. A A = Accept after S tingy, Accept after Gene rous   2. A R = Accept after Stingy, Reject after Gene rous   3. R A = Reject after Stingy, Accept after Gene rous  4. R R = Reject after Stingy, Reject after Gene rous         7 How to obtain NE  of an extensive game?    Convert the extensive game into a strategic form game, by renaming the strategies in  the extensive form as actions in the strategic form and making the payoffs to a terminal  history generated by a strategy profile as the payoffs to an action profile.   • Note : ◃  A terminal history : a sequence of actions that specifies what may happen in the  game from the start of the game to an action that ends the game.          Any extensive form game can be written in strategic form:       Responder     A A A R R A R R    Propo ser     Stingy  9 , 1 9 , 1 0 , 0 0 , 0    Generous  5 , 5 0 , 0 5 , 5 0 , 0        \\uf0de  pure strategy Nash equilibria:  1. (Stingy, A A)           2. (Stingy, A R)           3. (Generous, R A)  8   Example 2 :                                  1  C D  2  1  E F  G H 2,0  3,1  1,2 0,0 9     The above extensive game is converted as below                          NE: (CH, F), (DG, E), (DH, E)         Nash equilibrium   The set of Nash equilibria of any extensive game with perfect information is the set of  Nash equilibria of its strategic form     1, 2 3, 1   0, 0 3, 1   2, 0 2, 0   2, 0 2, 0 CG  CH   DG  DH E F 10 ➢ The notion of Nash Equilibrium ignores the sequential structure of an extensive game.   ➢ It treats strategies as choices made once and for all before play begins.   ➢ So, the steady state to which a NE corresponds may not be robust.   ➢ For example, in the previous g ame (CH, F) is one of the NE. But when it’s player 1’s turn  to move after history E, will she really choose H over G?    ➢ We need to define a new concept that models a robust steady state.   ➢ For this, we define a subgame . For any non terminal history h, the subgame  following h is the  part of the game that remains after h has occurred.   ➢ Subgame Perfect Equilibrium  is a refinement of the  NE for extensive games.      11       • The mini ultimatum game has three subgames:    1. The whole game    2. The game after Stingy    3. The game after Generous          Proposer          Stingy         Generous           Responder           Responder        Accept      Reject      Accept     Reject          (9 , 1)   (0 , 0)        (5 , 5)   (0 , 0)       12 Subgame perfect equilibrium    (Selten, 1965)  – SPNE     A subgame perfect equilibrium is a strategy profile s* with the property that in no  subgame can any player i do better by choosing a strategy different from si*, given that  every other player j adheres to strategy sj*.     \\uf0de every subgame perfect equilibrium is a Nash equi librium    \\uf0de a subgame perfect equilibrium induces a Nash equilibrium in every subgame    \\uf0de not every Nash equilibrium is subgame perfect  13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    • In the mini ultimatum game:         Proposer       Stingy      Generous      Responder      Responder     Accept   Reject    Accept   Reject     (9 , 1)   (0 , 0)    (5 , 5)   (0 , 0)       1. (Stingy, A A) is N.E. and subgame perfect   2. (Stingy, A R) is N.E. but not subgame perfect   3. (Generous, R A) is N.E. but not subgame perfect, this N.E. uses incredible threat        14 So in the  extensive game  of example 2 , (CH, F) and (DH, E) are NE but not SPNE;   (DG, E) is SPNE.     ➢ Motivation for subgame perfection: players may trem ble    ➢ Finite horizon : the set of subgame perfect equilibria can exactly be identified with     backward induction     ➢ Every finite extensive game with perfect information has a subgame perfect equilibrium                      15   Finding SPNE in finite horizon games using Backward Induction     ➢ An extensive game is finite  if it has finite horizon (i.e., the length of the longest terminal history is  finite), and the number of terminal histories is finite.   ➢ Length of a subgame : the length of the longest history in the subgame   Backward Induction   1. Find the optimal actions of the players who move in the subgames of length 1   2. Taken the actions found in step 1 as given, find the optimal actions of the players who move first in the  subgames of length 2.   3. Continue this procedure, until you reach the start of the game . 16 Exercise  for you     Find the SPNE of the Entry Game using backward induction.

IWhat strategy should a rational person choose in the above Grade game? IIn order to answer the above question, we ﬁrst need to know the answer to the following question: What does this person care about? IIn other words what ’payoﬀ’ does each outcome yield for this person? 877Copyright  t.sco.sc Ga.scm.sce.sc   Fo.scr.scm.sc Ga.scm.sce.scs.sc  a.sc Ga.scm.sce.sc: Na.scs.sch.sc      a.scn.scd.sc Pr.sci.scc.sce.sc        IGame Theory cannot tell us what payoﬀs to assign to outcomes. IThis depends on the preferences and moral sentiments? of the players, not just player 1’s but also the opponent player 2’s. IBut Game Theory has a lot to say about how to play the game once payoﬀs are known. IPossible payoﬀs: Selfinterested players. For example, if every player is selfinterested, each only caring about her own grade then (assuming she prefers A to B etc.) the payoﬀs might be as follows. 977Copyright  t.sco.sc Ga.scm.sce.sc   Fo.scr.scm.sc Ga.scm.sce.scs.sc  a.sc Ga.scm.sce.sc: Na.scs.sch.sc      a.scn.scd.sc Pr.sci.scc.sce.sc       Th.sce.sc   (  two.taboldstyle’s.sc ) Player 2 # #   Player 16;68;5 5;87;7 Table: Payoﬀ Matrix 1077Copyright  t.sco.sc Ga.scm.sce.sc   Fo.scr.scm.sc Ga.scm.sce.scs.sc  a.sc Ga.scm.sce.sc: Na.scs.sch.sc      a.scn.scd.sc Pr.sci.scc.sce.sc       Ho.scw.sc t.sco.sc Pl.sca.scy.sc t.sch.sce.sc Ga.scm.sce.sc?

INote (ﬁxing the other ﬁrm’s strategy) if either ﬁrm deviates to a higher price, it loses all its customers and so fails to increase its proﬁts to above zero (proﬁts remain at zero). So for either ﬁrm, there is no incentive to deviate and set a higher price. IGiven the other ﬁrm’s price at c, if one ﬁrm lowers the price to below marginal cost, it is worse oﬀ as the proﬁts become negative. Therefore, for either ﬁrm there is no incentive to deviate to a lower price. IThe Nash Equilibrium prices are pa=pb=12. Substituting the prices in the demand function will yield Q=12012=108. Each ﬁrm supplies half of the market output, i.e., qa=qb=108=2=54. 7177Copyright  t.sco.sc Ga.scm.sce.sc   Fo.scr.scm.sc Ga.scm.sce.scs.sc  a.sc Ga.scm.sce.sc: Na.scs.sch.sc      a.scn.scd.sc Pr.sci.scc.sce.sc         ITo show that there are no other Nash equilibria other than the strategy proﬁle (pa;pb) = (12;12), you can section the price and cost combinations as follows.

The Bertrand model generates zero proﬁts because only slight price discounts are needed to bid away customers. The assumption behind this is that the two ﬁrms sell identical goods. If customers have brand loyalty or poor price information, the equilibrium is diﬀerent. This exercise is an example of a diﬀerentiated Bertrand model. Let us now move to a diﬀerent duopoly market, where the demand curves facing AandBare qa=242pa+pb and qb=242pb+pa; and they have constant marginal costs of c=3 1.
