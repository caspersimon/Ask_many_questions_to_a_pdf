    "## how the programme works\n",
    "\n",
    "This programme is made to answer a collection of questions about a collection of pdf files. It uses a Large Language Model similar to ChatGPT, \n",
    "but this one is from the company Cohere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cohere is a company that serves mostly other businesses for, for example, chatbots that can interact with customers. They made an LLM that can work with an enormous amount of context, and they offer an API to interact with the model. The only limit (for non-business users) is 10 requests per minute, but there is no word limit. This allows us to insert all the text from a pdf article into a prompt and receive an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**step-by-step, this is what the code does:**\n",
    "1. First, it itentifies the filenames and paths of pdf-files in a designated folder: `folderpath`.\n",
    "2. It will convert each pdf file into a .txt file that the computer can read.\n",
    "    * It will store these .txt files in the same folder as where your pdf's live. You can check these files if there are any issues.\n",
    "3. It identifies a list of questions from a designated .txt file: `questionspath`\n",
    "    * You should create this file manually. Each line should contain a new question. You can see the example of how to format this.\n",
    "4. For each combination of question and file, it will send a prompt to the chatbot that starts with \"Hey! I'm trying to understand this paper. Can you help me with a question about this text?\", followed by the text and question.\n",
    "    * you can change this prompt by changing the `write_csv` function listed under step 3 below.\n",
    "5. It stores the answers in a .csv file in the same folder as your pdf's. You can now easily open it in e.g., Excel, Numbers, or Google Sheets\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook was made by https://github.com/caspersimon/Ask_many_questions_to_a_pdf. Feel free to use it and share it with whoever might find this useful.**"
